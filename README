# Room Allocation Web Application

This project is a web application to facilitate digitalizing the hospitality process for group accommodation. The application allows users to upload two CSV files to efficiently allocate rooms in hostels while ensuring group members with the same ID stay together and adhere to hostel capacities and gender-specific accommodations.

## Features

- Upload CSV files for group information and hostel information.
- Allocate rooms based on group size, gender, and room capacity.
- Download the allocation result as a CSV file.

## Technologies Used

- Flask (Backend)
- Pandas (Data processing)
- HTML, CSS, Bootstrap (Frontend)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <your_github_repository_url>
    cd room_allocation
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install Flask pandas
    ```

3. Run the Flask application:
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```

4. Open `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser to access the application.

## Sample CSV Files

Place your sample CSV files in the `data` directory:
- `group_info.csv`
- `hostel_info.csv`

## Room Allocation Logic

The room allocation logic ensures:
- Members of the same group (same ID) stay in the same room as much as possible.
- Boys and girls stay in their respective hostels.
- Room capacity is not exceeded.
